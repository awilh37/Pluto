# Pluto

This is an app that will allow people to share their schedules with friends and classmates to see who is in what classes with who, including who has what lunches. The schedule will be constantly updated and show each user what class is next based on their personal schedule, as well as see what classes other users have. There will also be profiles for each user that can be viewed by other users including name, grade, profile pic, and their schedule. 

# JULES
## Jules, please use the following checklist while creating the app, checking boxes as you go. Please remember that for each test, I will be unable to test it without you releasing the iteration to me, so please remember to release it before asking if it worked. 
- Initilize Firebase (If this task is not checked off, please do NOT go any further until we have linked firebase and firestore. Only then can this be checked off)
- Simple login system including username/password login
- Simple user creation system including a way to create a username/password and name for the account
- Landing page for when the user logs in, showing the schedule for the day.
- - If the user has not yet added their schedule to Pluto, show a button that links to their profile where they can add their schedule
